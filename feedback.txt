In this prototype we extensively tested ourselves.

From external testers:

Tester 1:
Was slightly confused by disabled buttons, suggested changing their background colour (not just text colour as is default) -> Implemented
Otherwise liked the application.

Tester(s) 2:
Had no problems using and enjoyed the application.

Tester 3:
Found a bug when trying to load images with spaces or accent marks -> cv2.imread problem so not fixable, but added warnings to the interface
								      and stopped it from crashing


Final testers:
Less familiar with computer lingo (for example R,G,B)-> language clarified overall
